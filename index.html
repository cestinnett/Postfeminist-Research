        <h2>About This Research</h2>
        <p>This project critically examines how contemporary advertising and digital media shape feminist discourse by analyzing the intersection of feminism, consumer culture, and technology. It explores how feminist language is commodified in advertising, turning activism into a marketable aesthetic that aligns with neoliberal values. 
        Additionally, the research investigates how social justice movements are appropriated by brands to sell products rather than create meaningful societal change. 
        
        Another key focus is the role of digital media in shaping gender performance, reinforcing stereotypes, and regulating online identity. By analyzing trends such as postfeminism in advertising and the rise of feminist branding, this project provides insights into the broader implications of these shifts on gender representation and cultural expectations.</p>
